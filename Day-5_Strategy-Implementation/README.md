## This folder contains the resources from **Day 5: Strategy Implementation (Probability Extensions)**. 

1. Ahead of class:
	* Students should have submitted their strategy brainstorms, including a plan for their program. 

2. During class, 
	* Students worked on their program, executing the plan they submitted ahead of class.
	* I moved among Zoom rooms to consult students about issues they were having.

3. I used GitHub Classroom to distribute the lab assignment. Students worked in pairs ("Duos"). I used the [Qwixx-Strategy/](./Qwixx-Strategy/) directory as a template repo. Pre-class instructions were disseminated via Slack and the course LMS. The repo's [README.MD](./Qwixx-Strategy/README.MD) file gave explicit instructions on the formatting I expected from their submissions, including guaranteeing that no function they wrote would mask another function, no global variables should be used, no additional libraries should be loaded, and which lines should be commented out before submission. All of these instructions were crucial to running the simulation smoothly. Students had about ten days to write these. An additional class day may have been helpful for some students.
