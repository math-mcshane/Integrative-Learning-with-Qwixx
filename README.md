# Integrative-Learning-with-Qwixx
A repo for instructors wishing to run their own version of the activity that I described [at JSM](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2021/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=319030), [in this talk:](https://youtu.be/ivuEVW7MUlk)

[![JSM 15-minute talk](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ivuEVW7MUlk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivuEVW7MUlk)

Changes are forthcoming to this public repo after using this project again myself in Fall 2021.
