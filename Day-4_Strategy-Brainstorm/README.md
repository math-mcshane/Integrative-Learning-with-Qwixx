## This folder contains the resources from **Day 4: Strategy Brainstorm (Planning)**. 

1. Ahead of class:
	* I lightly edited the best `.R` script, distributed it to students, and asked them to read it in advance. The script is fairly well-commented. I would recommend you default to this script (please let me know if you see any glaring issues!) so that **we can have student strategies compete head-to-head**! This script is [QwixxProgram.R](./Qwixx-Strategy-Brainstorm/QwixxProgram.R)
	* As part of the course, I have one pair of students (in this case, the authors of the best `.R` script) take scribe notes which are peer-reviewed (by a different pair) and distributed to the rest of the class as notes. These scribe notes in [Week-3_Hands-on-Programming-in-R-for-Qwixx.pdf](./Week-3_Hands-on-Programming-in-R-for-Qwixx.pdf) were distributed to students in advance of "Day 4". In particular, pages three and four describe key features of the program. 

2. During class, 
	* Students brainstormed (in their duos) what they wanted to implement in their strategy. 
	* Students were prompted to think in at least two ways: 
		* If they were playing IRL, what decisions would they make and how would they play?
		* If they could compute things live, what would they want to know and what would they want to take into account? That is, how could they incorporate probability, Markov chains, decision analysis, and game theory into their strategy?
	* Students also planned their program using their tool(s) of choice (control flow diagrams, pseudocode, etc). 
	* I switched between Zoom rooms to engage with the students in their thinking and sought to help them push themselves further. 

3. I used GitHub Classroom to distribute the lab assignment. Students worked in pairs ("Duos"). I used the [Qwixx-Strategy-Brainstorm/](./Qwixx-Strategy-Brainstorm/) directory as a template repo. Pre-class instructions and files were disseminated via Slack and the course LMS. At the end of class or within 48 hours, students needed to submit their strategy brainstorm. This was the standard by which I ultimately graded their strategies.
