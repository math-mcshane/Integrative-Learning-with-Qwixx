# qwixx-spreadsheet
Lab #2 assignment -- create Qwixx spreadsheet which auto-calculates a score. 

Your spreadsheet should: 
1. Retain the cell coloring and formatting from the original spreadsheet ††. 
2. †† (Except the numbers on green and blue should be re-ordered)
3. Calculate a total score dynamically -- every calculation should use cell references (rather than hard-coded values). 
4. Be an `.xlsx` file
5. The Excel file should include your name at the end. I.e., `Qwixx Simulation McShane.xlsx` for me. 

Add the spreadsheet to your repo in its main directory (i.e., `qwixx-spreadsheet-UN/Qwixx Simulation LN.xlsx`)
